When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Create a remote repository if you are not at your regular machine, for example. 
Or another collaborative user has created a file in the project from another machine and it has been pushed to GitHub.


Wny might you want to always pulls changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Similar to making local commits, you want to choose the best time to push and 
pull changes to maintain control over what is on the local machine.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

Fork is only on GitHub. Clone is a copy where local is involved. Branch is 
iterative and will track changes made.
