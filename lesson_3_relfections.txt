When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Create a remote repository if you are not at your regular machine, for example. 
Or another collaborative user has created a file in the project from another machine and it has been pushed to GitHub.


Wny might you want to always pulls changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Similar to making local commits, you want to choose the best time to push and 
pull changes to maintain control over what is on the local machine.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

Fork is only on GitHub. Clone is a copy where local is involved. Branch is 
iterative and will track changes made.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

It gives you the latest version of what is on the remote repo so you know what 
changes you will be making and how they will affect the existing code base.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub, all changes would have to manually enumerated in a 
written document, then communicated to others, probably with email. Maybe 
some kind of Excel file. This would be a giant pain in the ass. Really, 
nothing would be any easier when doing this the old-fashioned way.
