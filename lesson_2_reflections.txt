What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This configures the directory to be examined by git and begin tracking files 
for changes and version control. You must init so git knows to start.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area holds files to be committed, but can be reverted if necessary. 
It's a cache before making a commit. A staging area, really.
